Install MySQL (if it's not already installed):
Windows: Download from MySQL Installer.
Mac: Use Homebrew: brew install mysql
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): sudo apt-get install mysql-server
Python 3.9
- MySQL 8.x
- Libraries:
  - `mysql-connector-python`

### **4. Ensure Python 3.9 is Installed**

Lastly, make sure Python 3.9 is installed on your local machine or environment:

- **Windows**: Download and install Python 3.9 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).
- **Mac/Linux**: Use `brew` (for Mac) or package manager for Linux to install Python 3.9.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that the project uses Python 3.9 along with the necessary dependencies, and users will be clear about the environment setup.
